  # Project 2 - *Wordle 2*

Submitted by: **Richard Martinez**
 
**Wordle 2** is an app that, in each round, you will be given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues that  indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts.
    
Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

Some challenges with building the app were finding ways to subtly improve the app. One of these subtle things was slightly increasing the size of the individual boxes that were selected.
