# Project 2 - *Wordle 2*

Submitted by: **Richard Martinez**

**Wordle 2** is an app that, in each round, you will be given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts.
 
Time spent: **9** hours spent in total
  
## Required Features 
 
The following **required** functionality is completed:  

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

Some challenges with building the app were finding ways to subtly improve the app. One of these subtle things was slightly increasing the size of the individual boxes that were selected.
